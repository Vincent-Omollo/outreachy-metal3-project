            <h4>What to Know</h4>
            <p>The Metal3 project is an open-source, community-driven initiative that seeks to deliver a
                 bare metal infrastructure automation platform for Kubernetes. Its primary goal is to 
                 enable organizations to manage and provision bare metal servers similarly to virtual 
                 machines on public clouds like AWS and Azure. The project aims to remove the complexity 
                 and inefficiencies of managing physical infrastructure by providing a standardized and 
                 automated approach to bare metal deployment. 
                 <br>
                 <br> The Metal3 project is part of the Kubernetes cluster API effort, which aims to provide a
                  standard set of APIs for managing different types of resources in a Kubernetes cluster,
                   including bare metal servers. The Metal3 project leverages the cluster API to create and
                    manage Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers. It also extends the Kubernetes API to
                     manage hardware resources like storage, network, and power management. </p>

                <h5>Bare Metal Operator:</h5>
                <p>This Kubernetes operator automates the deployment and management 
                    of bare metal servers. The Bare Metal Operator leverages the cluster API to create 
                    and manage Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers. It also integrates with hardware
                    management tools like BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) to control power and 
                    hardware resources.</p>

            <p>The Metal3 project offers several benefits to organizations managing bare metal infrastructure. 
                Firstly, it provides a standardized and automated approach to deploying and managing bare 
                metal servers, which reduces the complexity and inefficiencies associated with managing 
                physical infrastructure. Secondly, it enables organizations to leverage the benefits of 
                Kubernetes, such as workload portability and scalability, on bare metal infrastructure. 
                Thirdly, it provides a consistent management interface for different types of resources 
                in a Kubernetes cluster, including bare metal servers.
                The Metal3 project is actively developed and maintained by a community of contributors 
                from various organizations, including Red Hat, Google, Intel, and Equinix Metal. The project
                 welcomes contributions from the district and provides several ways for individuals to get 
                 involved, such as contributing code, testing, documentation, and participating in discussions.
